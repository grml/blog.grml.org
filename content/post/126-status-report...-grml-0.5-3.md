A lot of development has taken place in the last few weeks and days. We now have a full featured 2\.6\.14\-grml kernel with udev replacing hotplug\-light (thanks, Tobias!). Using bt\-hid it's possible to connect a bluetooth mouse, some more bluetooth scripts are work in progress... grml2hd supports initrd (and therefor installation on scsi and usb\-devices). Improved synaptics touchpad support, ip addresses of network interfaces are displayed in GNU screen (thanks, Gebi!) and lots of other nice stuff. :\-)
Now we are waiting for kernel 2\.6\.15, in the meanwhile we are continuing [work on the big quality check](http://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=upcoming). We plan to release grml 0\.6 and grml\-small 0\.2 at beginning of 2006\.
