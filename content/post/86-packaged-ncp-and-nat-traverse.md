title: packaged ncp and nat-traverse

---
I packaged [ncp](http://www.fefe.de/ncp/) (a utility for copying files in a LAN) on request by wuehlmaus a few days ago. Today I packaged [nat\-traverse](http://linide.sourceforge.net/nat-traverse/) (establish connections between nodes behind NAT gateway). You can find them [in the grml\-repos](http://grml.org/repos/).
