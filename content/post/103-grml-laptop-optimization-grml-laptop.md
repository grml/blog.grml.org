Hardware recognition of grml is quite stable. But there exist are some laptops which require deep woodo and magic to work as intented to. Some laptops provide additional hotkeys and specific resolutions which might not work right out\-of\-the\-box. Therefore I just created the package grml\-laptop:

I will add a cheatcode laptop\=... for using those scripts. So if you would like to see a script for a specific/your laptop: please contribute!
