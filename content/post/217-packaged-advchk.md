I [created a Debian package](http://hg.grml.org/advchk/) of [advchk](http://advchk.unixgu.ru/), a tool for monitoring the security of installed software. Advisory Check gathers security advisories using RSS / RDF / XML feeds, compares them against a list of known software, and alerts you if
you\`re vulnerable. As usual the Debian package is available via [the grml\-testing pool](http://deb.grml.org/).
