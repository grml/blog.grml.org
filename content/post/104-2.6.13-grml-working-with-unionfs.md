Good news! I just booted 2\.6\.13\-grml with unionfs working. Thanks to Dave Quigley and the other unionfs\-guys for their work! That was a very important step for current state of grml. Today (14th of september) we will have a developer meeting in Graz and a new devel\-release should be available really soon now. There's only one release\-stopper left, that's the new config\-framework. People out there: we are coming closer to grml 0\.5\. :)
