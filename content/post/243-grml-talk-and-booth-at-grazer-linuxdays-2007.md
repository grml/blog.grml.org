---
[Grazer Linuxdays 2007](http://linuxtage.at/) will take place on 19th of May at FH Joanneum. I'll give a (german) [talk about grml](http://linuxtage.at/99/) and we will have a grml booth at the event. We (several grml developers are there!) will present grml 1\.0 of course, showing all the cool and rocking features. Hope to see you there! :\-)
