title: grml on linuxdays graz

---
[Grazer Linuxday](http://linuxtage.at/) on 20th of may was fun. I was giving two talks, one about '[successful opensource project maintenance](http://linuxtage.at/65/)' and the other one about [grml](http://linuxtage.at/63/) of course.
Someone showed me his really small and cute gadget where he successfully installed grml. I really enjoyed playing with it. :\-)

And as mentioned in the [the Gentoo Linux Newsletter](http://www.gentoo.org/news/de/gwn/20060515-newsletter.xml) we had a tricky setup of the booths:
