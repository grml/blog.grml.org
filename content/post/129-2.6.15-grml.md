See [kernel\-information webpage](https://grml.org/kernel-devel/) for more details. If you want to test 2\.6\.15\-grml on your box(es), you are welcome to [download them](http://dufo.tugraz.at/~prokop/grml-kernel/2.6.15-grml/). I'm running a few more tests and finishing work on [todolist](http://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=todo) before I'm releasing a preview\-release of grml 0\.6 for betatesters. I'll be working on grml\-small with 2\.6\.15\-grml also to be able to release grml\-small 0\.2 too.
