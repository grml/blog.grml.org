title: 'Request for Comments / Poll: removal of LaTeX on grml'

---
Especially on grml64 we are running out of space and we are thinking about removing LaTeX from grml, which would save us 100MB of uncompressed space. We're talking about the following Debian packages:

> auctex catdvi ctioga dvipng gnuhtml2latex lacheck latex\-beamer
> latexmk latex\-mk latextug latex\-xcolor libkpathsea4 libtioga\-ruby
> libtioga\-ruby1\.8 pdfjam pgf preview\-latex\-style tetex\-bin tex\-common
> texify texlive texlive\-base texlive\-base\-bin texlive\-common
> texlive\-doc\-base texlive\-extra\-utils texlive\-fonts\-recommended
> texlive\-lang\-german texlive\-latex\-base texlive\-latex\-recommended
> texpower tth vim\-latexsuite
We'd like to know **your** opinion on this issue, so please let us know your opinion through the [removal of LaTeX on grml poll](http://doodle.com/3dnzvhv43tmhpcpn).
