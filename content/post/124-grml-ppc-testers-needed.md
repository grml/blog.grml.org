Yes, that's not a joke. A ppc\-port of grml exists. :\-) If everything works as expected a first develrelease of the grml\-ppc live\-cd will be available on this weekend (\~27th of november). Formorer (who works on the ppc\-port) needs testers. So if you own a power pc machine, are interested in the grml\-ppc flavour and want to help us: please let us know! Either [drop us a mail](https://grml.org/contact/) or contact us via [\#grml](https://grml.org/irc/). Any help appreciated!
