Gebi and me packaged [zfs\-fuse](http://www.wizy.org/wiki/ZFS_on_FUSE) for Debian/grml. [ZFS](http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/) is an advanced modern general\-purpose filesystem from Sun Microsystems, originally designed for Solaris/OpenSolaris. zfs\-fuse is a port of ZFS to the FUSE framework for the Linux operating system. Just get the debian package from grml\-testing pool or just wait for grml 1\.0\. :\-)
