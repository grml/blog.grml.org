As I mentioned on grml\-devel I've put a devel\-release online today. It uses 2\.6\.11\-grml with full unionfs\-support. I've had some problems with unionfs ('cp skipping file ... as it was replaced while being copied') but could fix this via using a current snapshot. In the next few days I'll implement the missing stuff in grml\-x, do some more quality assurance and work on the installer (grml2hd) with Jimmy.
