Recently two Grml developers sadly left our [development team](http://grml.org/team/). Christian Hofstaedtler and Gerfried Fuchs, we wish you all the best \- thanks for all your work within the Grml community!

Now you might be wondering how you could become a Grml developer. We're happy to announce [grml.github.com](http://grml.github.com/), a place which should get interested people ready to contribute without much headaches. Please [help us](http://grml.github.com/) making Grml an even better kick ass solution!
