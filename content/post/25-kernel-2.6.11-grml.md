In the last few days I've been busy working on kernel 2\.6\.11\-grml. A [webpage for development on 2\.6\.11\-grml is available online](https://grml.org/kernel-devel/). Please notice that the kernel is still under development but the core stuff has been integrated already. I would be happy to receive feedback.
