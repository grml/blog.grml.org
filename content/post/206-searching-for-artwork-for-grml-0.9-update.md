title: searching for artwork for grml 0.9 [update]

---
We don't have artwork for grml 0\.9 yet (besides a fallback version from myself) and therefore the release\-name for grml 0\.9 isn't stable either. So if you want to 'immortalize' yourself in grml and can contribute a nice wallpaper and/or a cd\-cover: please [let me know](https://grml.org/contact/)!
**Update:** wallpaper is ready, release\-name as well (thanks for ideas \- formorer and Martin Piskernig!). The cd\-cover is pending but will be done in the next few days...
