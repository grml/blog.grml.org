No, we aren't in holidays, instead we are busy working on a new stable release. Lots of development took place at the [grml\-live framework](https://grml.org/grml-live/) front, we have a big kernel upgrade (see [grml\-kernel repository](http://hg.grml.org/grml-kernel/file/tip/2.6.23/) for details or just grab the Debian packages from [the grml\-testing repository](http://deb.grml.org/)) which involves support for speakup (thanks to [feadora's speakupmodified.org](http://speakupmodified.org/)). We also have support for [lzma within squashfs](http://www.squashfs-lzma.org/) in our toolchain now. A first release candidate of a new stable release of grml will be available soon....
