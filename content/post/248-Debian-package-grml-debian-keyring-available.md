Thanks to formorer we have a [grml\-debian\-keyring](http://deb.grml.org/pool/main/g/grml-debian-keyring/) Debian package now. This package provides the GnuPG archive key of the grml.org repository for using the GPG signature checking with apt \>\=0\.6\. More details can be found in [the Debian webpage in the grml\-wiki](http://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=debian).
