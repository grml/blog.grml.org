title: plans for upcoming releases

---
I'm busy working on [the new grml\-config\-framework](https://grml.org/config/). As soon as it's finished and work on 2\.6\.12\-grml too I'll release grml 0\.5\. To make the progress more transparent I created a new page in [the grml\-wiki](http://wiki.grml.org/): ['Plans for upcoming releases'](http://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=upcoming) \- there you will also find a list of packages which will be removed in the upcoming release. 
Please [let us know](https://grml.org/contact/ "https://grml.org/contact/") if you think a package should not be removed. If you have any special wishes just write it down [in the wiki\-wishlist\-page](http://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=wishlist).
