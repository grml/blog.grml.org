[![](/images/gkrellShoot_04-15-06_192047.serendipityThumb.jpg)](/images/gkrellShoot_04-15-06_192047.jpg)Finally I'm running grml with Xorg 7\.0\. I've been busy working on finding bugfixes for some common problems. Now grml\-x is Xorg 7\.0 ready as well. See [my mail on grml\-user mailinglist](http://lists.mur.at/pipermail/grml/2006-April/000354.html) for more details about some common problems... and please notice [my other mail regarding Xorg updates on your box](http://lists.mur.at/pipermail/grml/2006-April/000348.html) as well.  

*Reminder: If you are using grml in a productive environment and/or use a grml2hd installation we strongly recommend to [subscribe to the grml\-user mailinglist](https://grml.org/mailinglist/)!*
