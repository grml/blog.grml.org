Finally it's done \- we have new release candidates:

* [grml 1\.1\-rc1 \- Codename Skunk](https://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-1.1-rc1/)
* [grml64 0\.2\-rc1 \- Codename Schwammerlklauber](https://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml64-0.2-rc1/)
* [grml\-medium 0\.1\-rc1\- Codename Pfuh](https://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-medium-0.1-rc1/)
* [grml64\-medium 0\.1\-rc1 \- Codename Pfuh](https://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml64-medium-0.1-rc1/)

Summarizing the development of more than 7 month of development for the release notes was a pretty tough job. 7 month you might ask? Yes, for the first time we have a longer delay than the usual \~3 month between two stable releases. The reason is simple: we wrote a new build framework named [grml\-live](https://grml.org/grml-live/) and reworked the build process therefore. Thanks to grml\-live we are able to autobuild grml\-ISOs in several different flavours and on different architectures without the need for any further manual interaction. This allows us to provide automatically generated [daily snapshots of grml](http://daily.grml.org/) to the public (as you might know already). Now we have the first releases of grml being based on the work of grml\-live. Enjoy!
