A new full\-featured version of 2\.6\.20\-grml (revision grml.04\) is available in the grml\-testing pool. It's based on 2\.6\.20\.6 and I plan to use it as stable kernel for the new develrelease grml 0\.9\-7, the upcoming grml 1\.0\-rc1 and the final stable version as well if everything works as expected. It's already integrated within my latest devel\-ISO and I'm working on the last few issues on the todolist. Expect to get a new develrelease within the next few days.... Same applies to grml64 and grml\-small as well... Now going back to work...
