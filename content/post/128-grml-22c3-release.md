I just finished work on the 'grml 22c3 release'

 [The 22nd Chaos Communication Congress](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/) (December 27th to 30th, 2005\) will take place in Berlin/Germany. I'm not on the event (lacking time), but several [grml team members](https://grml.org/team/) and beta\-testers will be there! 'grml 22c3' is *not* a public release, it is only available for beta\-testers and people at 22c3\. It's a preview release of the upcoming grml 0\.6 which will be available in january 2006\.
