title: The  Linux sdparm utility (update)

---
I just packaged sdparm (because the .deb on the homepage is generated by alien ;\-)):

*The sdparm utility outputs and in some cases modifies SCSI device parameters. When the SCSI device is a disk, sdparm's role is similar to its Linux namesake: hdparm which is for ATA disks that usually have device names starting with "hd". More generally sdparm can be used to output and modify parameters on any device that uses a SCSI command set. Apart from SCSI disks, such devices include CD/DVD drives (irrespective of transport), SCSI and ATAPI tape drives and SCSI enclosures.*

**Update:** Tomas Fasth made [an ITP \[bug \#312580\]](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=312580), so you'll find it in Debian soon.
