Today Gebi and me had a developer meeting and concentrated on working with [mercurial](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/). We figured out the mq\-extension (Mercurial Queues, similar to quilt) for working with Linux kernel and the grml patches, improved ACL system on [our repositories](http://hg.grml.org/), set up push notification via mail and extended [our mercurial documentation](https://grml.org/mercurial/). Thanks for the interesting day, Gebi.
