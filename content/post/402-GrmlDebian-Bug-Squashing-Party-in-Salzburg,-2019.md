title: Grml/Debian Bug Squashing Party in Salzburg, 2019

---
The [Debian project](https://www.debian.org/) hosts a Bug Squashing Party in Salzburg/Austria, taking place from April 5th to April 7th 2019\. A Bug Squashing Party is a come\-together of developers, contributors and enthusiasts who try to fix as many bugs as possible.

We’ve been invited to join the Bug Squashing Party and since Grml is an official derivative of Debian we’re more than happy to take this opportunity. This is the perfect time and place to meet with fellow Grml and Debian developers, contributors and friends, to make the next Debian\- and Grml\-Release the best ever! :)

The key facts:

* Location: conova communications GmbH, Karolingerstr. 36A, 5020 Salzburg, Austria
* Date: 2019\-04\-05 (Friday) until 2019\-04\-07 (Sunday)

If you want to join us please visit [wiki.debian.org/BSP/2019/04/Salzburg](https://wiki.debian.org/BSP/2019/04/Salzburg "Debian BSP Salzburg") for further information. If you’ve any questions feel free to [reach out to us](https://grml.org/contact/ "contact information").
