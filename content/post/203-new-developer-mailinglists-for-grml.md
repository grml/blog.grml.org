title: new developer mailinglists for grml

---
[formorer](http://grml.org/team/#formorer) did an excellent job in the last few days improving infrastructure of grml. One of many tasks was the setup of new [mailinglists for grml](http://ml.grml.org/splash/index.en.html). What might be interesting for you is the [grml repository commits mailinglist](http://ml.grml.org/list/hg-commits.en.html) which allows tracking of all the commits to [our mercurial repositories](http://hg.grml.org/). Thanks again, formorer!
