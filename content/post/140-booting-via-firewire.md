title: booting via firewire

---

As you maybe know grml is already capable of booting from CD via firewire. Now we are also able to boot a grml2hd installation via firewire (thanks to maks for the initramfs\-update). So we aren't limited to external usb devices but you can use your portable grml\-installation even on external firewire devices. :\-)
Note: currently initramfs on usb devices is broken, I hope this issue can be fixed within the next few days...
BTW: I also have a kernel 2\.6\.16\-grml featuring reiser4\-support now... grml 0\.7 is coming closer...
