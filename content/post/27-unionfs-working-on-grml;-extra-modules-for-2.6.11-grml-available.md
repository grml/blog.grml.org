title: unionfs working on grml; extra modules for 2.6.11-grml available

---
I now have a grml\-ISO running with [unionfs](http://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/project-unionfs.html), now it's possible to run 'apt\-get install foobar' when running from CD. :\-)

I had to use some hacks (thanks to the debug\-bootparam ;\-)) to get unionfs working. But it shouldn't be that much work to make it more elegant and working smooth. ;\-) If I can handle it a devel\-release might be available at the weekend.

I also did some work on the extra\-modules, most of them [are available](http://dufo.tugraz.at/~prokop/grml-kernel/) already. Take a look at the [kernel\-devel\-webpage](http://grml.org/kernel-devel/) for some more information.
