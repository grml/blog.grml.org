Yesterday I installed a plain Debian sarge system, added the grml\-repository to apt's sources.list and did an "apt\-get install grml". And it worked :\-)

The debian system now uses grml's hardware recognition system. Even grml\-x works right out of the box with Debian's XFree86 (grml provides X.org). I will create a script which does all the necessary steps to get a "debian system grml\-ized". The "create a grml system out of a debian system" was a long time goal, but we are already very close to it. :\-)
