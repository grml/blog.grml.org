I just finished main work on 2\.6\.13\-grml including all the extra modules. Now I'll update documentation on [grml.org/kernel\-devel/](https://grml.org/kernel-devel/) and will integrate the kernel in chroot of grml 0\.4\-3\. I'm running 2\.6\.13\-grml already on my develmachine, works very fine so far.Testing and feedback are welcome (as usual): [download .debs from kernel\-repository](http://dufo.tugraz.at/~prokop/grml-kernel/2.6.13-grml/)
