So we did it again \- we just released Grml 2017\.05 \- [Freedatensuppe](https://grml.org/faq/#releasename)!

This Grml release provides fresh software packages from Debian testing, what's going to be released as stable release Debian/stretch in just a few more days. As usual it also incorporates current hardware support and fixes known bugs from previous Grml releases.

More information is available in the [release notes of Grml 2017\.05](https://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-2017.05/).

[Grab the latest Grml ISO(s)](https://grml.org/download/) and spread the word!

Thanks everyone and happy grml\-ing!
