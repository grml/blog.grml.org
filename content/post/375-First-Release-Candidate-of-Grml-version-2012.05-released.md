title: First Release Candidate of Grml version 2012.05 released

---
We are proud to announce the first release candidate of the upcoming version 2012\.05, code\-named 'Ponyhof'!

For detailed information about the changes between 2011\.12 and 2012\.05 have a look at the [official release announcement](https://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-2012.05-rc1/).

Several tools that have been reported to be missing on the downsized 2011\.12 release have been re\-added. This release also brings the grml\-small flavour back to life.

Please test the ISOs and everything you usually use and report back, so we can complete the stable release soon. If no major problems come up, the next iteration will be the stable release, which is scheduled for end of May.
