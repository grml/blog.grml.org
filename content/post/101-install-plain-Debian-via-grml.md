title: install plain Debian via grml

---
I just created a new tip named "Install (plain) Debian via grml" [in the grml\-wiki on the tips\-page](http://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=tips). It's a short (example) guide how to install a plain(!) Debian system via grml and debootstrap. I just tested it on my box using the current grml\-small\-snapshot. Rocks :\-)
