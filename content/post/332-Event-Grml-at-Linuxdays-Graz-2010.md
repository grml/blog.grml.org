title: 'Event: Grml at Linuxdays Graz 2010'

---
Several Grml team members will be present at [Linuxdays in Graz](http://www.linuxtage.at/) on Saturday, April 24th 2010\. If you ever had any questions \- this is the time to contact us in real life! :\-)
Thanks to data rescue specialist Attingo ([Attingo](http://www.attingo.com/)[Datenrettung](http://www.attingo.com/)) we can offer free Grml CDs to every visitor. The CD contains the upcoming version 2010\.04 of Grml, codename Grmlmonster. We also have Grml USB pens with multiboot setup of the Grml release (32 and 64\-bit), posters and even coffee cups.
Project leader Michael Prokop will give a [talk about Deployment and Disaster Recovery with Grml](http://www.linuxtage.at/grml/). Make sure to visit us, grab some CDs and USB pens while they are hot, and share your experience with Grml. For people not familiar with the shell and the console based workflow Sven Guckes will give a [workshop about console programs](http://www.linuxtage.at/texttools/) using Grml for it.
If you ever wanted to to get in contact with team members and users of Grml, learn something about console tools, simply meet interesting people or just listen to informative talks visit us and the other projects at [Linuxdays in Graz](http://www.linuxtage.at/) and have a good time.
