As [written in my personal blog](http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2006/05/11/grml-on-my-notebook/) I've got some grml\-CDs:
![grml utils - photo](http://michael-prokop.at/blog/img/grml-utils_small.jpg)The grml\-CDs will be available with the upcoming [german LinuxUser magazine 06/2006](http://www.linux-user.de/). If you join [the linuxday graz on 20th of may](http://linuxtage.at/) you can get one of them!
If you are holding a lecture or workshop using grml on the computers or plan to do so [please let me know](https://grml.org/contact/) so I can ship you grml\-CDs!
