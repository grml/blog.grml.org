So we did it again \- we just released Grml 2018\.12 \- Gnackwatschn!

This Grml release provides fresh software packages from Debian testing, what's going to be released as stable release Debian/buster in 2019\. As usual it also incorporates current hardware support and fixes known bugs from previous Grml releases.

More information is available in [the release notes of Grml 2018\.12](https://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-2018.12/).

[Grab the latest Grml ISO(s)](https://grml.org/download/) and spread the word!

Thanks everyone, happy new year and happy Grml\-ing!
