title: version controll information inside grml's zsh prompt

Thanks to the work of Frank 'ft' Terbeck we have a zsh prompt featuring useful information about different version control systems found inside the current working directory. That's what it looks like on my developer system:
[![screenshot](/images/gkrellShoot_08-08-27_125155.png)](/images/gkrellShoot_08-08-27_125155.png)The according zsh configuration can be found in [the hg repository](http://hg.grml.org/grml-etc-core), [standalone](http://grml.org/console) or as Debian package grml\-etc\-core version \>\=0\.3\.52 in the [grml\-testing repository](http://deb.grml.org/) as well.
