We will have a grml developer meeting on 17th of may in [Realraum Graz](http://realraum.at/wiki/doku.php) (Sporgasse 16\) starting at 2 o'clock pm ("14 uhr" local time ;\-)). [Alexander 'formorer' Wirt](https://grml.org/team/#formorer) is visiting Graz for a few days and will be at the develmeeting too. We will do some further bughunting and if everything goes fine we will finalize the stable release. If you want to help us on getting out the new stable releases you're invited to join us!
