title: updated dmraid available, some more packages...

I just packaged [dmraid](http://people.redhat.com/~heinzm/sw/dmraid/) so we have an up2date version on grml. As usual you can get it via the [grml\-repos](http://grml.org/repos/).

grml\-x isn't part of grml\-scripts anymore but got it's own package. ddclient, fish, mondo, multi\-aterm, splint, vifm and some more packages are also part of grml now.

On the weekend I'll put a new develrelease for beta\-testers and grml developers online. There won't be really new features but just some bugfixes and updated and new packages.
