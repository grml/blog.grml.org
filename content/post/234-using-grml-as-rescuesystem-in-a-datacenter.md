title: using grml as rescuesystem in a datacenter

---
Marc 'Zugschlus' Haber wrote a very nice article named '[using grml to prepare LVM surgery](http://blog.zugschlus.de/archives/530-using-grml-to-prepare-LVM-surgery.html)' where he describes how he is using grml as rescue system in the datacenter of the well known german ISP named Strato. It's definitely worth reading [the article](http://blog.zugschlus.de/archives/530-using-grml-to-prepare-LVM-surgery.html). Thanks for the nice article, Marc!
