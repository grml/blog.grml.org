> SFS\-KNOPPIX is a kind of KNOPPIX which boots form Internet with a cloop on SFS(Self\-certifying File System). It requires small boot loader (20MB image) and offers full KNOPPIX functions, Autoconfig, etc. 
> 
> SFS\-KNOPPIX makes possible to change a cloop file (root file system of KNOPPIX) at boot time. It means we don't need to burn extra CD for many KNOPPIX offshoots.
