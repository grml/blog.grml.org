I'm proud to be able to announce 'grml\-small 0\.1' with codename 'Zugschlus' (because it was inspired by [Marc 'Zugschlus' Haber](http://blog.zugschlus.de/).) It's a \~50MB\-ISO which fits on a business card CD\-ROM. For more details take a look at [the release](http://grml.org/files/README-0.1-small.txt) [announcement](http://grml.org/files/README-0.1-small.txt).
Please report feeedback!
