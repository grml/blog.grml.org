Work on kernel [2\.6\.16\-grml](http://dufo.tugraz.at/~prokop/grml-kernel/2.6.16-grml/) has been finished. It's based on 2\.6\.16\.1 and includes support for speakup, squashfs 3\.0, iteraid, sdhci and reiser4\. All the external modules usually provided by grml are available as well, take a look at [the kernel\-devel webpage](http://grml.org/kernel-devel/) for details.BTW: Besides some updates in configuration files I also added support for detection of resume, speakup\_synth, swspeak and brltty bootoptions to grml2hd\-bootparams. This means you shouldn't need to add the options manually to lilo's append\-line anymore.
A new develrelease (grml 0\.6\-8\) will be available at the weekend. grml 0\.7 is coming closer...
