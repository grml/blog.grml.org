We planned to arrive at [Chemnitzer LinuxTag 2005](http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2005/info/) on 4th of March bringing grml\-shirts with us. The producer of the shirts was at hospital, but as it looks like it might work anyway ('last\-minute action'). So grml\-devel\-guys: chances to get a shirt in Chemnitz are not *that* bad. ;\-)
