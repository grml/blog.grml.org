We have another devel release for grml\-developers and [beta\-testers](https://grml.org/beta-tester): grml 0\.4\-2\. Main features are:
* kernel 2\.6\.12\-grml including several additional modules (see [grml.org/kernel\-devel/](https://grml.org/kernel-devel/)) and an updated udev\-package (version [060](https://grml.org/repos/udev_0.060-1_i386.deb)) \[thanks to Tobias!]
* replaced hotplug with hotplug\-light
* new grml\-autoconfig infrastructure
Now I'll finish my work on grml\-small and hope to be able to upload grml\-small 0\.1 really soon.... (hmpf)
