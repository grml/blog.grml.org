Thanks to Thomas Ulz, we have debian packages for the brand new [ATI Proprietary Linux Driver Version 8\.25\.18](https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/674/9206/0/www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/linux_8.25.18.html) compiled against 2\.6\.16\-grml. As usual they are available through [the grml repository](http://grml.org/repos/).
