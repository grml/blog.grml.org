Currently I'm working on shortening the [todolist](http://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=todo). Nearly no serious issues are left, just some improvements on some scripts have to be done. grml2hd needs to be extended and the grml\-configframework is the last release stopper. Now I'm working on 2\.6\.13\-grml:

```
mika@grml ~ % uname -a  
Linux grml 2.6.13-grml #1 Tue Aug 30 10:15:41 CEST 2005 i686 GNU/Linux  
mika@grml ~ %
```
It supports squashfs, reiser4 and vesafb\-tng already. If everything goes fine with all the extra\-modules (ipw, ndiswrapper,...) I will ship grml 0\.5 with 2\.6\.13\-grml.
BTW: I've a new developer machine now: a Samsung X20 XVM 1600 V laptop.
