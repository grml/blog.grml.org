title: Results of the FrOSCon 2009 Grml contest

---
At the [grml booth at FrOSCon](http://blog.grml.org/archives/325-Event-grml-at-FrOSCon-2009.html) we had a contest for the best release name, feature request,... for grml. Out of 16 contributions we elected the first five places. That's the result:1. Sebastian Harl: Release\-Name: "Grmlmonster"- Axel Beckert: Release\-Name: "Hello Wien"- Axel Beckert: zsh should set terminal title to previous jobtitle instead of 'fg'- Christian Vervoorts: choose i386/amd64 automatically depending on the architecture- Christian Bricart: ship libsmbios\-bin for flashing BIOS

The winner (Sebastian Harl) will receive a special grml USB pen and a copy of the
[german LinuxUser magazine edition (2009/08\)](http://blog.grml.org/archives/323-Grml-2009.05-LinuxUser-Edition.html) featuring the Grml\-DVD. Places 2 to 5 receive a copy of the german LinuxUser magazine edition (2009/08\).
Thanks to all contributors for participating and hope to see you at [FrOSCon 2010](http://froscon.org/)!
