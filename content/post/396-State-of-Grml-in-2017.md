A new stable release of Grml is long overdue and sadly we didn't manage to release a new stable release in 2016 [either](http://blog.grml.org/archives/394-Is-Grml-still-alive.html).

But in Q4 of 2016 we made *actual* progress with the systemd integration and the according branches should be ready soon for merging to master. A new kernel based on v4\.8\.15 has been uploaded to grml\-testing a few days ago and is included in our daily ISOs already.
We don't want to promise anything we can't hold, but we should have (at least) an RC version available within Q1/2017\.
