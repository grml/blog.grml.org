After a long delay we finally have new develreleases (yeah!): grml / grml\-medium / grml64 / grml64\-medium, version 2008\.09\.28\.

Quoting the main changelog:
* kernel 2\.6\.26\-grml (based on 2\.6\.26\.5 with additional patches)
* using a new version schema: as we want to improve tracking of all the different flavours and releases of grml we decided to use "$flavour\-devel YYYY.MM.DD" for the develreleases and "$flavour $YYYY.MM" for the stable releases. No further confusing "grml 1\.1 vs. grml64 0\.2". ;)
* several new packages, tons of updates, bugfixes, configuration improvements,... \-

Sorry for not being more verbose but I've an influenza and don't have the mind for working on a detailed changelog, more information will follow.
