I wrote a buildsystem for grml\-kerneladdons which allows me to build the appropriate package for every single kernel version of grml much faster now. So you can grab grml\-kerneladdons for the first release of [2\.6\.18\-grml](http://dufo.tugraz.at/~prokop/grml-kernel/2.6.18-grml/) already. Notice that the package is named grml\-kerneladdons\-2\.6\.18\. This provides the possibility to install several kernelpackages at the same time without any conflicts. The package includes tpm\-emulator and ipw3945 as well now.
