title: First Release candidate of Grml version 2011.12 released

---
We are proud to announce the first release candidate of the upcoming version 2011\.12, code\-named "Knecht Rootrecht"!

For detailed information about the changes between 2011\.05 and 2011\.12 have a look at [the official release announcement](https://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-2011.12-rc1/?pk_campaign=Blog&pk_kwd=201112rc1) .

This release brings a downsizing and cleanup: one flavour, two architectures. The new, smaller flavour has a 350MB ISO size target, while still delivering over 1\.1GB of open source software relevant for system administrators!

Give it a try and [download grml 2011\.12\-rc](https://grml.org/download/prerelease/?pk_campaign=Blog&pk_kwd=201112rc1) and report back to us.

Please test the ISOs and everything you usually use and [report back](https://grml.org/contact/), so we can complete the stable release soon. If no major problems come up, the next iteration will be the stable release, which is scheduled for end of December.
