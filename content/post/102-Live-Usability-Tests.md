title: Live Usability Tests

---
I'm planning to run "live usability tests" with the grml\-system within the next few weeks. grml is mainly used by sysadmins and texttool\-freaks (as those users are the target audience ;\-)). But it seems that a lot of people use grml because "it just works" even though they are neither sysadmins nor texttool\-geeks.grml shouldn't be only a distribution with good hardware recognition and "lots of the right tools" but also be comfortable to use. Running usability tests should help us to improve handling of grml.
I'm interested in your opinion regarding what kind of tests might be useful for grml. I already wrote down some basic steps but would like to get your feedback.
Last but not least: I'm searching for people in Graz/Styria who would like to be part of the usability study. It does not matter whether you are a sysadmin or texttool\-user, I'm searching for people from all kinds of background. It won't take longer than 30 minutes per person and you will get one of the limited special\-edition CDs of the grml 0\.5\-release for free.
Don't hesitate [to contact me](https://grml.org/contact/).
