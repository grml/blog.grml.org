I put the new grml devel release (grml 0\.4\-1\) online today, as already mentioned it includes mainly some bugfixing, updates and new packages.

What I'm currently working on is a configuration framework. grml 0\.5 should provide a well documented and smart way of handling all the configuration stuff. I wrote down what I'm planning to provide with grml 0\.5: [grml.org/config/](http://grml.org/config/) - [feedback is - as usual - welcome](http://grml.org/contact/).
