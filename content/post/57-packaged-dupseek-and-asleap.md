title: packaged dupseek and asleap

---
I packaged [asleap](http://asleap.sourceforge.net/) (tool for penetration testing Cisco LEAP wireless access points) and [dupseek](http://www.beautylabs.net/software/dupseek.html) (a command\-line interactive perl program to find and remove duplicate files).
There are several updates in grml\-etc and I improved grml\-lock (now it also supports locking of X). We are coming closer to grml 0\.4\.
