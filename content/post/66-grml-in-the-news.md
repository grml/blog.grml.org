I just read the [Gentoo Weekly Newsletter: May 23th, 2005](http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20050523-newsletter.xml) and found grml mentioned in section 'Austria: Grazer Linuxtage was a success'. :\-)

Tobias told me that grml is mentioned in the german it magazine c't in current edition 12/2005 on page 60 with [softlink 0512060](http://www.heise.de/ct/05/12/links/060.shtml).

BTW: I'm collecting all the press links on [grml.org/press/](http://grml.org/press/). If you find another ressource where grml is mentioned please let me know.
