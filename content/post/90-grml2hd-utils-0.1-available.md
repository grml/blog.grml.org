grml2hd\-utils is a collection of some scripts which might be useful for people who installed grml to harddisk. For example remove\-packages\-server is a script which will remove server packages on your grml\-system, useful for people who want to use grml as a plain workstation\-system. grml2hd\-utils itself is a frontend for the provided scripts. Just take a look at it (it's available via [the grml\-repos](http://grml.org/repos/)) and report feedback. Suggestions for additional scripts you would like to see are welcome too of course.
