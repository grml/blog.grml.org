I just uploaded the first version of kernel 2\.6\.28\-grml\[64] to [the grml\-testing repository](http://deb.grml.org/). Details about configuration and patches are available in [grml's git kernel repository](http://git.grml.org/?p=grml-kernel.git). A new develrelease providing the new kernel will be available as well as [daily snapshots](http://daily.grml.org/) featuring the new kernel soon.
