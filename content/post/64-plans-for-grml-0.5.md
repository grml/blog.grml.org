Besides replying to all the mails receiving my grml\-mailbox in those days I'm trying to improve some stuff at grml of course. In the next few days we'll have another grml\-developer\-meeting and we will discuss what will be main features of grml 0\.5\.
What's currently on the todo\-list:
* improve grml2hd (automatic installation of grml to harddisk)
* more documentation (grml user guide)
* improved configuration handling
If you have any special wishes or just general feedback [please let me know](http://grml.org/contact/).
