---
For the last 16 years (since 2008!) we hosted our own Git infrastructure and had a mirror of our Git repositories at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).

While running your own infrastructure clearly has its benefits, it also requires maintenance efforts, for which we no longer really have the workforce nor enjoyment we used to have. We also appreciate the social effects you get from platforms like GitHub. We therefor decided to switch to GitHub as our primary Git hosting place. Over the last days, we migrated from git.grml.org to github.com by putting according URL rewrites into place.

We also used to host our own DokuWiki for more than 19(!) years. In the last few years we didn't have any actual wiki changes, so we decided to also migrate this over to GitHub, and also there put according URL rewrites into action.

Now all our Grml Git repositories can be found at [github.com/grml](https://github.com/grml/), and our Wiki is available at [github.com/grml/grml/wiki/](https://github.com/grml/grml/wiki/).
If you should notice any problems with any of our services, please [reach out](https://grml.org/contact/).
