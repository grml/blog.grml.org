The meta package grml 0\.6 is available in [the grml\-repository](http://grml.org/repos/). This means you can run 'apt\-get update ; apt\-get install grml' and you will get the up2date grml\-core packages on your grml harddisk installation. I've done several tests, the update from grml 0\.5 to grml 0\.6 went smoothly and without any problems.
If you do consider any problems during upgrade don't hesitate to [contact us](http://grml.org/contact/).
