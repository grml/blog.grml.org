title: final build of 2.6.17-grml

---
The final build of 2\.6\.17\-grml is available. It's based on 2\.6\.17\.7, including [some more patches](http://dufo.tugraz.at/~prokop/grml-kernel/2.6.17-patches/) and supports SMP and reiser4\. I could manage to build all extra modules as well. If you want to install the debian packages before they are going into the grml\-repository [get them from the usual place](http://dufo.tugraz.at/~prokop/grml-kernel/2.6.17-grml/).
The kernel is integrated and running with(in) current grml\-build 0\.7\-5f. A new develrelease will be available within the next few days. Then we'll have the big find\-bugs\-and\-report\-them\-so\-we\-can\-fix\-them week before grml 0\.8 is available as a new stable release.
