[Chemnitz Linuxdays 2007](http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2007/info/) were great. Several [grml developers](https://grml.org/team/) (including myself) have been there, we even had our own [grml booth](http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2007/live/plan.html):

We had two Efika boards at the grml booth (one from formorer and the other one from myself).

Formorer and me did some further work on the ppc\-port of grml:

The grml\-team had the chance to test one server of [the Linux cluster in chemnitz](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/84925) \[Chemnitzer Hochleistungs\-Linux\-Cluster (CHIC)] with grml. The server is a IBM System x3455 featuring Dual\-Core AMD Opteron Processor, DDR2\-RAM and AMD's virtualization technology 'Secure Virtual Machine' (SVM).

The cluster machine running grml:

Output of /proc/cpuinfo running grml:

Oh, and as you can see in the last picture we had CDs of a special grml release (0\.9\-5\) at the grml\-booth!
