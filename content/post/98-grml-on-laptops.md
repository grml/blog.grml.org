title: grml on laptops

---
Today I created a new page in the grml\-wiki: [grml on laptops](http://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=laptops)  
The target of the page is to collect information regarding problems with laptops. Often it's just a short commandline, bootoption or keypress which strongly improves hardware support/the situation in general with grml.
If you have some spare time please contribute!
