I added [szs2nd](http://wmi.modprobe.de/index.php?n=WMI.Szs2nd) and [sti.pl](http://strcat.neessen.net/dotfiles/wmi/sti.pl) to grml\-etc (0\.2\-13\). Those tools improve the statusline of windowmanager WMI. szs2nd is loaded by default now.
Updated /etc/skel/.zshrc and /etc/zsh/zshrc as well.

Current ISO build 0\.2\-9b works like a charme. :\-)
