title: several updates + kernel 2.6.11

---
Martin sent me his script grml\-pptp\-xdsl\-students (thanks!), I updated grml\-muttng, Christoph Wegscheider sent me a fix for szs (statusbar for WMI), several updates in grml\-etc and finally Jimmy and me fixed grml2hd (thanks, Jimmy!). Now I'll do some more testing. 0\.3 is coming closer! :)

BTW: [Kernel 2\.6\.11 is available](http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0503.0/0287.html). This means that as soon as we release grml 0\.3 I'll start working at the kernel.

If you want to see any (special) patches inside grml\-kernel please let me know!
