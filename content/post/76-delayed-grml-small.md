I decided to delay grml\-small for a few days. A "light version" of [kernel 2\.6\.12\-grml](/archives/75-kernel-2.6.12-grml.html) is already part of the grml\-small\-ISO. I now want to include [the new grml\-autoconfig framework](/archives/74-grml-autoconfig-revisited.html) and therefore I need some more time. Sorry for that, but expect a rocking grml\-small. ;\-)
