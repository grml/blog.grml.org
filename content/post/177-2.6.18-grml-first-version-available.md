A first version of [2\.6\.18\-grml is available](http://dufo.tugraz.at/~prokop/grml-kernel/2.6.18-grml/):

grml@grml \~ % uname \-a  
Linux grml 2\.6\.18\-grml \#1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Sep 22 20:37:07 CEST 2006 i686 GNU/LinuxNotice: the current version does not include ipw3945 and reiser4 yet. Due to API changes several external modules don't build yet, I'm working on it. Please report any problems you notice and if you have feature requests for the grml\-kernel feel free to [contact me](http://grml.org/contact/)!
