We are proud to announce the first release candidate of the upcoming version 2014\.10, code\-named 'Gschistigschasti'!

This Grml release provides fresh software packages from Debian testing (AKA jessie). As usual it also incorporates up2date hardware support and fixes known bugs from the previous Grml release.

For detailed information about the changes between 2014\.03 and 2014\.03(\-rc1\) have a look at [the official release announcement](https://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-2014.10-rc1/).

Please test the ISOs and everything you usually use and report back, so we can complete the stable release soon. If no major problems come up, the next iteration will be the stable release, which is scheduled for end of October.
