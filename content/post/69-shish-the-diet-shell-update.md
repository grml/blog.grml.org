I just packaged shish:

*shish is a shell language interpreter and an interactive command line interpreter. This shell aims at being very small and doing its tasks in efficient ways (and not through 100 abstraction layers), which is mainly done by using the dietlibc and libowfat libraries and by design considerations according to Fefe's excellent howto. shish will be a POSIX compatible shell language interpreter according to the IEEE P1003\.2 Draft 11\.2 by its 1\.0 release.*

As usual you can find the package in [the grml-repos](http://grml.org/repos/).

**Update:** I just made the [ITP (intend to package) \[bug \#312660\]](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=312660).
