We have new release candidates: the first release candidate of version 2009\.05 codename "[Lackdose\-Allergie](https://grml.org/faq/#releasename)" is available. Take a look at the [release announcement](https://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-2009.05/) for details about all the nifty new features. As usual we have different flavours available: the 32bit versions grml, grml\-medium and grml\-small as well as the 64bit versions grml64, grml64\-medium and grml64\-small.
Please test the ISOs and all the stuff you usually need so we can provide rocking stable releases soon. Download the ISOs from devel directories of the mirrors listed at [grml.org/download/](https://grml.org/download/).
