---
As written [in my private blog](http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2006/11/11/amd64-grml/) (german article only, sorry) I own a amd64 system now. A [grml64 kernel is available](http://dufo.tugraz.at/~prokop/grml-kernel/2.6.18-grml/) and I already have a first working grml64 live\-cd version. I plan to be able to release a first public version of grml64 together with grml 1\.0\. Stay tuned.
