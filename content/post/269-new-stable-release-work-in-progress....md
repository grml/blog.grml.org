title: new stable release work in progress...

---
Just to keep you informed: we planned to release the new stable grml versions during this weekend. Due to [local root exploits in the Linux kernel](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=464953) we decided to work on an updated kernel version. So please stay tuned a little bit further, we expect to be able to provide the final stable release within the next few days. Sorry for the delays, but hopefully we can provide a rocking stable release really soon now.
