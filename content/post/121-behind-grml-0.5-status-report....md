So, what has happend since release of grml 0\.5?
Of course some bugfixing (most of the [grml\_0\-5\-issues](http://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=grml_0.5) have been fixed). I also added some new features like a wrapper script for a fluxbox setup providing idesk and gkrellm out\-of\-the\-box, some new scripts and I just finished base work on kernel [2\.6\.14\-grml](http://dufo.tugraz.at/~prokop/grml-kernel/2.6.14-grml/).
So a new develrelease will be available soon...
