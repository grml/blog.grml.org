title: roadmap to grml 1.0

What's my roadmap to grml 1\.0?
* kernel 2\.6\.20\-grml ([issue96](http://bts.grml.org/grml/issue96))
* grml\-ppc: provide a first version of grml for PowerPC ([issue95](http://bts.grml.org/grml/issue95))
* grml64: provide a first version of grml 64 bit version ([issue13](http://bts.grml.org/grml/issue13))
* use utf8 as default mode ([issue43](http://bts.grml.org/grml/issue43))
* grml2hd: use UUID for root\-device ([issue93](http://bts.grml.org/grml/issue93)), provide dialog for dis\-/enabling services ([issue89](http://bts.grml.org/grml/issue89)), support for grub within grml2hd itself ([issue81](http://bts.grml.org/grml/issue81))
Of course [resolving the other issues on grml's BTS](http://bts.grml.org/grml/) is on the todo list as well. Features like unionfs\-overlays and additional squashfs\-files are on the wishlist too of course. My plan is to release grml 1\.0 in march 2007\. Needs a lot of work of course...
