title: new grml-autoconfig, several other updates

---
I uploaded the new grml\-autoconfig\-framework to the [grml\-repos](http://grml.org/repos/). The configuration itself (/etc/grml/autoconfig) provides documentation, some more docs might follow. Now grml\-firefox is a seperate package for /etc/skel/.mozilla which provides a preconfigured firefox\-environment with some useful extensions (new added: ShowIP and ConQuery). Several other updates as usual in grml\-etc, grml\-scripts,...  
BTW: The current snapshot of grml\-small (grml 50MB\-ISO) works quite well so far (running with kernel 2\.6\.12\-grml), I'm locking forward to be able to publish it soon. grml\-usb (grml \~240MB\-ISO) is also coming closer. Please let me know which software you would like to see in grml\-usb!
