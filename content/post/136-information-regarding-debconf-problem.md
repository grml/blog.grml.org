I'm receiving many requests regarding [the debconf problem](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.distributions.grml.user/1) within the last few days. Please! If you are using grml in a productive environment and/or use a grml2hd installation I strongly recommend to suscribe to the  [grml\-user mailinglist](http://lists.mur.at/mailman/listinfo/grml) to stay informed about current issues. It's possible to read the mailinglist also [via gmane](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.linux.distributions.grml.user).
