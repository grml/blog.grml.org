A new version of [2\.6\.18\-grml is available](http://dufo.tugraz.at/~prokop/grml-kernel/2.6.18-grml/) (take a look at the [kernel repository](http://hg.grml.org/grml-kernel/) for details). This should become the final version of 2\.6\.18\-grml so it will be available in the [grml repository](https://grml.org/repos/) soon. A last few tests will take place, some docs have to be updated and then a first release\-candidate of grml 0\.9 will be available to the public.
