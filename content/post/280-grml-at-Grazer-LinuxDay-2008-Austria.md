---
Several [grml developers](http://grml.org/team/) met at the [Grazer LinuxDay](http://linuxtage.at/) (Austria) on 19th of april 2008\. Alexander held a [talk about Nagios3](http://www.linuxtage.at/134/), Jimmy talked about Backups, Gebi held a talk about ["Lockless Multithreading using Erlang"](http://www.linuxtage.at/138/) and I (Mika) was talking about ["Systemadministration\+\+ \- What really helps"](http://www.linuxtage.at/132/). Check out the [gallery](http://www.linuxtage.at/gallery/) to get an idea of the event. Oh, and at the grml\-booth we had a [Lenovo X300, running grml](http://www.linuxtage.at/gallery/.tmp/2008-04-19_15h22_152201.jpg.html) of course. :)
