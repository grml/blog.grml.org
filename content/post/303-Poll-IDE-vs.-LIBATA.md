title: 'Poll: IDE vs. LIBATA'

---
**Update on 2009\-04\-06: sorry, adjusted the wording. Should be \*IDE\* vs. LIBATA of course. Sorry for the confusion.**
The GRML Team wants to collect feedback regarding the recent switch from IDE to LIBATA. IDE? LIBATA?
* IDE (CONFIG\_IDE) provides the old IDE subsystem (/dev/hdX), considered as legacy code.
* LIBATA is the new subsystem (/dev/sdX \- though supports IDE as well) with new features, but some old IDE systems might not work with it.

Please [participate in the poll](http://doodle.com/vr75tpe4a2p6mwvt)! We highly appreciate and need your feedback.
