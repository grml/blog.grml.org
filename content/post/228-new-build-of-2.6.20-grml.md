title: new build of 2.6.20-grml

---
I [worked on a new version of 2\.6\.20\-grml](http://hg.grml.org/grml-kernel/rev/036807a852e7). The kernel features 2\.6\.20\.1, plus iteraid and unionfs now. Several external modules [are available](http://dufo.tugraz.at/~prokop/grml-kernel/2.6.20-grml/) as well, [some few are missing though](http://bts.grml.org/grml/issue96) (due to API changes in 2\.6\.20\). I just uploaded all the debian packages of 2\.6\.20\-grml to the grml\-testing pool.
