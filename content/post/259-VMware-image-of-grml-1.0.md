Ja Bu mentioned on the [grml mailinglist](https://grml.org/mailinglist/) that there's a ready\-to\-go VMware image of grml available at [www.vmware.com/appliances/directory/899](http://www.vmware.com/appliances/directory/899). I did not test it on my own yet but thanks to the uploader for providing that!
