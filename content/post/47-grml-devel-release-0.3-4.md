grml.superRelease 0\.3\-4 is available for grml developers and beta\-testers. All the work of the last two weeks has been integrated. Two brand new features are:  
  
  * Bootoption `small`: start with just a few consoles (should save RAM)
  * xsay: run `grml-x wmi`, select some text via mouse and press 'ctrl\-alt\-v' - you will hear the text as sound. (German speaking people can [get more information via my personal blog](http://www.michael-prokop.at/blog/index.php?p=346)).
