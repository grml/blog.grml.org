I just created a package namend grml\-fixes. From the package description:

> This package includes some fixes for the grml system.
> There are for example some problems with (upstream/debian)
> shell scripts and the zsh. Therefor this package fixes
> them until they are fixes upstream.
Now we are again a step closer to the big goal to be once able to run 'apt\-get install grml' on a plain Debian system and get a full\-featured grml\-system out of it. :\-)
