You might have heard about the [Freenode IRC drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode#Ownership_change_and_conflict"), and after more than 17 years of \#grml on Freenode, it's time to say goodbye.

We decided to move our IRC to [irc.oftc.net](irc://irc.oftc.net:6667), so please join us at [\#grml](irc://irc.oftc.net/grml) over there.

Thanks for the many years of great service to Freenode, thanks [OFTC](https://www.oftc.net/) for hosting us!
