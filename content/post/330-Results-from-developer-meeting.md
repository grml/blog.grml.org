title: Results from developer meeting

---
We had a developer meeting in Graz on thursday and friday. We were working towards a new stable release:* new versions of grml\-debootstrap, grml\-live, grml2hd,... are available
* we've a working kernel 2\.6\.33, expect to find Debian packages in grml's repository within the next few days
* we managed to close more than 100 issues in our bug tracking system over the last week

BTW: Some Grml developers will attend [linuxdays in Chemnitz/Germany](http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2010/) on 13rd and 14th of march. We don't have our own booth but you might find us around the Debian booth. Hope to see you there!
