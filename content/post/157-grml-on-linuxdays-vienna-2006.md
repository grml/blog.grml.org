![mika at his grml talk, picture by sven guckes](/images/grml_talk_wlt06_small.jpg)Some days ago I visited "[Linuxwochen Wien](http://linuxwochen.at/2006/Wien)". Of course I held a lecture about grml (including a presentation of the great [Zsh](http://grml.org/zsh/)): '[grml \- Linux Live\-CD f√ºr Sysadmins und Geeks](http://linuxwochen.at/2006/Programm_Wien:_grml_-_Linux_Live-CD_f%C3%BCr_Sysadmins_und_Geeks)', see the picture on the left (thanks go to Sven Guckes for the shot). On the second day of the event I had a talk about '[Erfolgreiche OpenSource Projekt\-Maintenance](http://linuxwochen.at/2006/Programm_Wien:_Erfolgreiche_OpenSource_Projekt-Maintenance)'. I was pretty amazed that so many people attended my talks, even though I had the first slot in the morning for the grml\-talk and the last slot in the evening for my opensource project maintenance talk. Some people even had to stand because they didn't get a seat. Nice. :\-)
If you're interested in the slides of my talks you can get them now:* [grml](http://grml.org/wlt06/grml_wlt06.pdf) (2\.3MB, pdf)
* [opensource project maintenance](http://grml.org/wlt06/os_project_maintenance_wlt06.pdf) (358kb, pdf)
I also met several people for the first time in reallife, to name some of them: Klaus 'koki' Ita, Markus 'markus23' Raab, Pablo 'redtux' Hoertner, David 'DavidS' Schmitt, Fabian 'lefant' Linzberger, Christian 'Greek0' Aichinger. And of course I met [Alfie](http://grml.org/team/) (AKA Rhonda). I really enjoyed meeting all of you!
We had a grml\-booth too. It was fun to share the booths of grml and debian. Usually the grml\-booth had to answer debian related questions and people behind the debian\-booth had to provide grml\-support. ;\-) I was \*really\* amazed how many people already use grml. 
Because of the presence at the grml\-booth I visited only few talks. Some interesting stuff:
* [Versionskontrolle mit svk](http://linuxwochen.at/2006/Programm_Wien:_Versionskontrolle_mit_svk): nice to see how svk works, you can bypass some limitations of svn
* [WIENUX \- und was die Stadt Wien noch mit Linux und Open Source tut](http://linuxwochen.at/2006/Programm_Wien:_WIENUX_-_und_was_die_Stadt_Wien_noch_mit_Linux_und_Open_Source_tut%21): very nice talk, very interesting to see how much open source software is being used in Vienna's government
* [socat \- Verkehr mit Sockets aller Art](http://linuxwochen.at/2006/Programm_Wien:_socat_-_Verkehr_mit_Sockets_aller_Art): socat is a multipurpose relay you might consider as netcat\+\+, definitely worth a look!
* [Bildbearbeitung per Shell](http://linuxwochen.at/2006/Programm_Wien:_Bildbearbeitung_per_Shell): nothing new for me, but a nice presentation by Sven Guckes of all the tools available on grml (convert, identify of the imagemagick suite, iimage, jhead,...) :)
Stuff I learned at the event:
* sudoedit rocks (thanks, DavidS)
* xscreensaver has a nice ['switch user' feature](http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/faq.html#logout-button) for gdm\-users (thanks, koki)
* Decr\_Console and Incr\_Console work out\-of\-the\-box on Debian and grml: just press alt\-cursor\-left and alt\-cursor\-right to switch between plain consoles (thanks for the hint, Sepp)
* [SubMaster](http://www.rocklinux.org/wiki/SubMaster) rocks. [Clifford](http://www.clifford.at/) showed me how it's used at RockLinux and I'm really impressed.
* ice\-spray and grml can rescue harddisks (thanks to *anonym*, please contact me if you read this line)
* [Maschu\-maschu](http://www.maschu-maschu.at/) really has the 'best Falafel in town' (at least it tastes like that ;))
If you want to browse some pics, thank Sven Guckes for his online gallery of linuxdays vienna:

I really enjoyed the event. The only bad news: I got ill in the night to friday, seems like a small burn\-out hit me. :\-(
