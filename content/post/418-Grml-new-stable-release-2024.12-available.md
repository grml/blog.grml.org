We are proud to announce our new stable release version 2024.12, code-named ['Adventgrenze'](https://grml.org/faq/#releasename)!

This Grml release brings you fresh software packages from Debian trixie, enhanced hardware support and addresses known bugs from previous releases.

With version 2024.12 Grml, for the first time ever, supports 64-bit ARM CPUs (Architecture `arm64`)!

This milestone was made possible thanks to the financial support from [netcup](https://www.netcup.com/).

As previously announced, releases for [32-bit x86 PCs have been discontinued]({{< ref "416-grml32-sunset" >}}).
With the grml32 flavor removed, we've introduced UEFI 32-bit boot support on our Grml amd64 flavor to ensure 64-bit PCs with 32-bit Firmware can use this release.

For a detailed overview of the changes from 2024.02 to 2024.12, please check out [the official release announcement](https://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-2024.12/).

Thanks to everyone who contributed to Grml and this release, stay healthy and happy Grml-ing!

Please join us in celebrating [20 Years of Grml Releases]({{< ref "417-20-years-grml-releases" >}}) and send us a postcard!
