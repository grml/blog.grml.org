We are proud to announce the new stable release version 2024.12, code-named ['Adventgrenze'](https://grml.org/faq/#releasename)!

This Grml release provides fresh software packages from Debian trixie. As usual it also incorporates current hardware support and fixes known bugs from the previous Grml release.

We are also proud to announce our first release supporting 64-bit ARM CPUs (Architecture `arm64`), which are up and coming everywhere.
At the same time we want to point out that releases for [32-bit x86 PCs have been discontinued]({{< ref "416-grml32-sunset" >}}).

For detailed information about the changes between 2024.02 and 2024.12 have a look at [the official release announcement](https://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-2024.12/).

Thanks to everyone contributing to Grml and this release, stay healthy and happy Grml-ing!
