title: update of zsh-lovers - in asciidoc format

---
It was on my todolist for ages, thanks to Christian '[strcat](http://strcat.de/)' Schneider we have the zsh\-lovers manpage in asciidoc format now. [asciidoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) provides much smoother output than my nroff hacks. :\-) Adding new tips is much easier now as well, especially since we maintain the manpage within a mercurial repository ([hg.grml.org/zsh\-lovers](http://hg.grml.org/zsh-lovers)). Get the zsh\-lovers manpage in manpage format, as HTML or PDF from [grml.org/zsh/](https://grml.org/zsh/#zshlovers), a Debian package is available via the [grml\-testing pool](http://deb.grml.org/) as well of course.
