While [being on Linzer Linuxday 2005 in the last few days](http://www.michael-prokop.at/blog/index.php?p=345) I packaged [s10sh](http://www.kyuzz.org/antirez/s10sh.html) (USB/serial userspace driver for the Canon PowerShot digital cameras).

Today I packaged latest trunk\-version of [Clifford Wolf's shadowfs](http://www.rocklinux.net/packages/shadowfs.html) (collection of various LD\_PRELOAD wrappers for adding fancy filesystem features).

I also updated grml\-scripts and grml\-etc (several small improvements and fixes), next develrelease is getting closer.
