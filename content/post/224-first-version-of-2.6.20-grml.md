A [first version](http://hg.grml.org/grml-kernel/rev/7a552dcb6a53) of kernel [2\.6\.20\-grml is available](http://dufo.tugraz.at/~prokop/grml-kernel/2.6.20-grml/):

```
Linux grml 2.6.20-grml #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu Feb 8 00:15:11 CET 2007 i686 GNU/Linux
```
Some external, extra modules are missing currently (compare with [grml.org/kernel/](https://grml.org/kernel/)) due to API changes. Anyway, I'd like to base grml 1\.0 on kernel 2\.6\.20\-grml so expect several updates in the next few weeks.
