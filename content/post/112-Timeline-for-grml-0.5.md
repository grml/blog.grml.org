title: Timeline for grml 0.5

---
The latest build of the grml\-kernel (2\.6\.13\-grml) has been integrated in the grml\-ISO. Currently I'm updating all software packages, finish work on grml2hd and the config\-fw. And of course I'm bugfixing and updating documentation.

The timeline for the upcoming release (if everything works like intended):

* \~15th of october: pre\-release grml 0\.4\-9: available for beta\-testers and developers; freeze of packages (no more updates, only fixes for grml\-packages); Notice: last chance to get your software and updates into the upcoming release!
* \~24th of october: grml 0\.5 will be released
