Great news. Now I'm part of the [Robocup team "Mostly Harmless"](http://www.robocup.tugraz.at/index.php) at [Graz University of Technology, Austria.](http://www.tugraz.at/) I will be working on kernelstuff, building debian packages and doing hardware recognition using grml technologies. An embedded system will be used with hardware like a [CAN Dongle](http://www.peak-system.com/db/de/pcandongle.html), compact flash cards, WLAN, serial connection and so on. This means I will work on grml as part of my studies at university at least for this semester.

Thanks to [Mabu](http://chaosfactory.org/) for his investigations!
