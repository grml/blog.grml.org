---
Now, the [Grml project](https://grml.org/) has accounts on both Twitter ([@grmlproject](http://twitter.com/grmlproject))
and identi.ca ([@grml](http://identi.ca/grml)). They will be used to publish Grml related
announcements, news and links. Tips related to Zsh, console programs and Grml itself will be part of the
regular posts as well.
The program used to post grml tips is available in our[git repository](http://git.grml.org/?p=grml-twitter-tips.git). If you have any suggestions
for this service or any additional tips and/or packages we should mention feel free to drop us a mail to
twitter (at) grml.org or create a bugreport in our [bugtracking system](http://bts.grml.org/).
Now make sure to follow the [Grml project](https://grml.org/) on[twitter](http://twitter.com/grmlproject) and/or[identi.ca](http://identi.ca/grml)!
BTW: Grml developers can use these accounts to send announcements \& messages as well.
For detailed instructions have a look at <http://twitter.grml.org>.
