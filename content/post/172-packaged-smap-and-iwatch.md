I packaged [smap](http://www.wormulon.net/index.php?/archives/1159-smap-0.4.1-released.html) (nmap like SIP scanner) and [iwatch](http://sourceforge.net/projects/iwatch) (a realtime filesystem monitoring program). Both programs are worth a try \- as usual get the Debian package from the [grml\-repository](https://grml.org/repos/).
