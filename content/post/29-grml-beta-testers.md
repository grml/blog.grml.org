I just started the [beta\-tester subproject of grml](https://grml.org/beta-tester/). Every 2\-3 weeks I'll provide a current devel\-snapshot to grml\-developers and beta\-testers so I get feedback from people using different software and hardware than me. If you think you could help the grml\-team you are welcomed to [join the grml beta\-testers](https://grml.org/beta-tester/).
