Wow, how time flies! 20 years ago grml.org was registered by Mika, and in 2004 we had our first public [Grml](https://grml.org/) release. ðŸ¥³ 

We're glad about such a wonderful community and are celebrating this with a small Easter egg in our [Grml daily ISOs](https://daily.grml.org/)! ðŸ˜œ 

And now for another 20 years? ðŸ¤“
