I'm sitting at the grml booth and we ran out of grml\-cds sooner than expected (now burning some more blank CDs on our own). Oh, BTW \- the grml booth is featured at [derstandard.at](http://derstandard.at/?id=2901241&_index=5). :)

My grml talk starts in less than 3 hours, I'm just checking my slides once more.
