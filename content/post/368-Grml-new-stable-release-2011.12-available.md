I am proud to announce our Christmas Gift to the community. We just released [Grml 2011\.12 \- Knecht Rootrecht](https://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-2011.12/?pk_campaign=Blog&pk_kwd=201112), just in time to put it under the Christmas tree. [Download](https://grml.org/download/?pk_campaign=Blog&pk_kwd=201112) the latest Grml ISO and spread the word.  


There were quite a lot of changes between [RC1](https://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-2011.12-rc1/?pk_campaign=Blog&pk_kwd=201112) and the new stable release. The most important ones are:
* Update to Kernel 3\.1\.6
* Easier remastering with grml\-live and existing Grml ISO images
* New GRUB boot theme
* SYSLINUX will indicate its boot menu with one beep
* GRUB will indicate its boot menu with three beeps
* Enable all mixer controls at startup and set volume to 75%
* Reworked and more flexible GRUB config file handling
* grml2usb \- use the GRUB configuration from the ISO image instead of creating a new one
* Additional keybindings for fluxbox
* Fix keyboard layout bug

You can get Grml now in **3** options \- grml32, grml64 and grml96 (32\+64, featuring both Grml versions).  
One flavour, two architectures, three options (grml32, grml64, and grml96\).


I want to thank all the people involved in this magnificent and awesome release. The [Grml Developers](https://grml.org/team/?pk_campaign=Blog&pk_kwd=201112), our Contributors and all the [other people involved](https://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-2011.12/#name?pk_campaign=Blog&pk_kwd=201112)  in this release.
