This year we're celebrating 10 years of Grml. I wrote some words about those [ten years of Grml in my personal blog](http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2014/12/22/ten-years-of-grml/).

The Grml team wishes you Merry Christmas to the ones of you who celebrate it and a Happy New Year! We hope to see you in 2015!
