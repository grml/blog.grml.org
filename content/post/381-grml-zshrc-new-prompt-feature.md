Grml developer Frank 'ft' Terbeck did great work for [grml\-zshrc](http://grml.org/zsh/) to get better customization options for the zsh prompt. We just uploaded grml\-etc\-core v0\.8\.0 to our [grml\-testing repository](http://deb.grml.org/) and want to mention three blog articles by Frank regarding this new prompt feature:
* [Prompt themes for grml](http://bewatermyfriend.org/p/2013/001/)
* [Appendix to zsh prompt themes in grml](http://bewatermyfriend.org/p/2013/002/)
* [grml zshrc: More items for prompts](http://bewatermyfriend.org/p/2013/003/)

The new grml\-etc\-core release also provides a rewrite of the way keybindings work. Please consult /usr/share/doc/grml\-etc\-core/NEWS.Debian.gz for further details regarding the new prompt and keyboard handling. If you notice any problems please [report a bug](http://bts.grml.org/) or just show up in \#grml on freenode and talk to us.
