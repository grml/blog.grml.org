title: Using grml? Let us know!

I'll hold a talk about grml at the [Open Source Data Center Conference](http://www.netways.de/english/osdc/y2009/) on 29/30 April 2009 in
NÃ¼rnberg/Germany.
I'd like to show the attendees how grml is used in Real World Environments and need your contribution!
You are using grml in your company for system recovery, presenting demos of your application, automated system installation,...? Please [let me know](https://grml.org/contact/)! This is \*your\* chance to present your company or product in my talk. :)
If it's necessary you can also submit your stories anonymously or request that I'll withhold your identity while presenting your setup.
Feel free to forward this information to anyone who might have interesting stories for me, I'd love to hear from you.
