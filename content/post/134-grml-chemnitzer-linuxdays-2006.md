title: grml @ chemnitzer linuxdays 2006

---
[Chemnitzer LinuxTag 2006](http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2006/info/) takes place at the beginning of march. Several grml developers will be there, including myself. :\-)  
I will present grml in a lecture named "[grml \- Debian\-basierte Live\-CD f√ºr Systemadministratoren und Texttool\-User](http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2006/vortraege/detail.html?idx=371)". I'll introduce what is grml and give a technical overview what's behind grml. Of course I'll present some of the rocking features like handy stuff of the zsh, some nifty tools and full automatic installation via grml2hd.
I'm working on a grml CLT06 edition and will carry grml\-CDs and grml\-shirts with me. Hope to see you there!
