Today I updated all my packages to latest upstream version. The following packages got up2date:

```
csync2, ded, dupseek, dmraid, ex, gateguardian, heirloom-sh, libacme-eyedrops-perl  
md5deep, mwcollect, pmtools-acpi, shadowsfs, sudosh, yersinia
```
grml 0\.5 is definitely coming closer. ;\-) Now I'll update documentation, finish work on the new config framework and then the prerelease will be available for beta\-testers. A few more days of bughunting and grml 0\.5 will be available. :\-)
