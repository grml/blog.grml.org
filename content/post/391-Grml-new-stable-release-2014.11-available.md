We just released Grml 2014\.11 \- Gschistigschasti.

This Grml release provides fresh software packages from Debian testing (AKA jessie). As usual it also incorporates up2date hardware support and fixes known bugs from the previous Grml release.

More information is available in the [release notes of Grml 2014\.11](http://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-2014.11/).

Special thanks to [Christian Hofstaedtler](http://deduktiva.com/) for helping us in solving a big release stopper caused by udev's net.agent on systems without systemd (AKA [\#754987](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=754987)).

[Grab the latest Grml ISO(s)](http://grml.org/download/) and spread the word!

Thanks everyone and happy grml\-ing!
