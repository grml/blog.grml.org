Yesterday Gebi, Jimmy and me had a final devel\-session for the upcoming grml release 0\.4\.
We did some bugfixing, improved grml2hd once again and tested grml\-terminalserver via a crossover cable from my laptop to jimmys one. We could boot grml via PXE and via floppy\-disk. Gebi, you did an awfull good job on grml\-terminalserver! :\-)
