title: "20 Years of Grml Releases"

---
On 22nd and 23rd of October 2004, an open source event called "[OS04](https://web.archive.org/web/20041203102012/http://www.os04.at/)" took place in Graz, Austria.
Jon "Maddog" Hall gave the keynote speech; and the first release of Grml was published.
Now, 20 years later, Grml is still around!

We would like to celebrate this milestone with our users from all around the world!
The team would like to collect postcards from Grml users everywhere and create a "Grml wall".
So if you are a Grml user, we would *love* to receive a postcard from where you live!

Our mailing address is:

```
Grml Solutions
Weblinger Strasse 75d
8054 Graz
Austria
```

Feel free to share your feedback with your postcard!
Where are you from? Why are you using Grml?
Maybe you have any special wishes for an upcoming Grml release?
Do you have anything else you always wanted to tell us?

We'd love to hear from you!
