We are back from [Chemnitzer Linuxdays 2006](http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2006/info/). It was fun and I really enjoyed meeting all the other grml developers! Thanks to Timo 'Spida' Boettcher for sponsering a box of [Club\-Mate](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate) to the grml\-team! :\-) [The slides of my german talk about grml are available online (1\.5 MB, PDF)](https://grml.org/clt2006/grml-vortrag_clt2006.pdf). We also have some pics (by Karl Voit, thx!): [clt06 gallery](http://dufo.tugraz.at/clt06/).
