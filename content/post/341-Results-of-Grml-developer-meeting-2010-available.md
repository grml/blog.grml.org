The hackathon for next Grml release took place on 4th and 5th november 2010 in the fantastic hackerspace [Metalab](http://metalab.at/) in Vienna/Austria.
Some highlights of this amazing event:
* formorer started to work on the new Grml Homepage and it looks great so far. Maybe it is finished for the new release
* ch organized the location and social event and closed many bugs
* jimmy implemented a special update\-grub feature for integrating Grml ISOs in usual hd installations during the meeting and debugged several issues
* gebi designed and started to develop a framework for non free tools like Raid controller or truecrypt (yes truecrypt is non\-free!)
* rhonda started to use Zsh and will be looking for fast mirrors outside of Europe.
* mika was just amazed about the donations and what was achieved during these two days. Thank you!
