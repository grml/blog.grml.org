Develrelease grml 0\.3\-3 is available for grml\-developers and beta\-testers since monday. In the last few days I fixed the reported bugs. I think I'll drop vesafb\-tng because there have been more problems than benefits with it. Now I'm working on improving the bootup sequence, checking bootoptions and some more misc stuff.
