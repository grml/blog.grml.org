Great news: the well known german IT news publisher [Heise](http://heise.de/) released a Linux magazine special named [c't kompakt 01/2009](https://www.heise.de/kiosk/special/ct/09/03/). On pages 120 and 121 you'll find a nice article about [grml](https://grml.org/) titled "Grml: Schweizer Messer f√ºr Admins" (meaning: "grml: swiss army knife for admins"). The included DVD provides a grml 2008\.11 ISO as well.
