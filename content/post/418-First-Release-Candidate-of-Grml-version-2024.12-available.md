We are proud to announce the first release candidate of the upcoming version 2024.12, code-named ['XXX'](https://grml.org/faq/#releasename)!

This Grml release provides fresh software packages from Debian trixie. As usual it also incorporates current hardware support and fixes known bugs from the previous Grml release.

We are also proud to announce our first release supporting 64-bit ARM CPUs (Architecture `arm64`), which are up and coming everywhere.
At the same time we want to point out that releases for [32-bit x86 PCs have been discontinued]({{< ref "416-grml32-sunset" >}}).

For detailed information about the changes between 2024.02 and 2024.12-rc1 have a look at [the official release announcement](https://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-pre2024.12-rc1/).

Please test the ISOs and everything you usually use and rely on, and report back, so we can complete the stable release soon.
If no major problems come up, the next iteration will be the stable release. We are hopeful to release before the end of the year 2024.
