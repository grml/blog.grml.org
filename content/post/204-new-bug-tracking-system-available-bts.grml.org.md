Thanks to formorer we have a new bug tracking system (BTS) at [bts.grml.org](http://bts.grml.org/grml/). It's mainly meant for developers so working together without forgetting any issues is easier. The [issues regarding stable releases](http://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=grml_0.8) will be available in the [grml wiki](http://wiki.grml.org/) as usual. So you don't have to care about the BTS unless you want to work together with grml developers or you are one of them. ;\-)
Notice to all grml\-developers: please register youself in the BTS so we can assign issues according... Please use [the webinterface](http://bts.grml.org/grml/user?@template=register) for the task and use a nickname which is the same as your grml.org mailaddress, thanks.
