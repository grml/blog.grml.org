I just packaged [git\-pasky](http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito/). git is the tool Linus developed in the absence of BitKeeper, a stupid (but extremely fast) directory content manager.

Petr Baudis maintains a git\-pasky branch of the content manager which he describes as, "my set of scripts upon Linus Torvald's git, which aims to provide a humanly usable interface, to a degree similar to a SCM tool."

Now grml\-users should be able to stay up2date at Linux kernel development. :\-)
