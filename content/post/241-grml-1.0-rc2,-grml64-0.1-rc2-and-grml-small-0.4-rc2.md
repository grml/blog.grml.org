Today I uploaded rc2 of the current releases, they are meant to be the last release candidates for the upcoming stable release. As the stable version will be available *really soon* (within the next 3\-4 days) I maybe won't even announce them "officially". So far the ISOs are available on [debian.netcologne.de](http://debian.netcologne.de/www.grml.org/devel/) only, grab and test them if you want to help the grml\-team to provide the stable release *really* soon.
