Inspired by [Marc Haber's posting in de.comp.os.unix.linux.misc](http://groups.google.at/group/de.comp.os.unix.linux.misc/browse_thread/thread/9c1ea81f6a1d6ae9/5220e8d133791129#5220e8d133791129) I was working on a small\-ISO variant of grml in the last few days. The ISO will fit on a business\-card\-CD. Thanks to Marc for his feedback!

Finally I've a 53MB grml\-ISO. I'll do some more testing in the next few days and will put the ISO online at the next weekend (\~19th of june) if everything works as intended.

JFYI: I'm working on the usb\-stick variant as well, stay tuned. ;\-)
