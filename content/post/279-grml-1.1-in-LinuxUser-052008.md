The [media edition 05/2008 of the german LinuxUser magazine](http://www.linux-user.de/ausgabe/2008/05) provides grml 1\.1\. You'll even find [a german article I wrote about grml](http://www.linux-user.de/ausgabe/2008/05/906/index.html) inside the magazine as well. So get it as long it's hot off the press and available! :\-)
