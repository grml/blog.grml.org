JFYI: Sorry to the ones of you asking questions in the grml develblog and not getting any answer. Due to a misconfiguration I never received any notifications about new, added comments. I found a workaround for the misconfiguration of supersized.org's mail notification so this issue should be fixed and I won't overlook any comments from now on. Sorry again, wasn't my intention.
