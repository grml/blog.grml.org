---
First of all sorry for the long time without any news in the grml develblog. Busy weeks, sorry.
In the last few weeks main work besides some bugfixing was providing a stable [daily\-grml](http://daily.grml.org/) service. Now we are waiting for the soon to be released stable version of the 2\.6\.26 linux kernel. Our plan is to provide a new development release featuring kernel 2\.6\.26 as soon as possible. New stable versions of grml should be available in august then.
BTW: On 23rd and 24th of august some grml developers will visit [FrOSCon](http://www.froscon.de/), a two day conference on Free Software and Open Source, taking place for the third time in Sankt Augustin/Germany. We plan to make a grml booth as well as a coming\-together\-hacking\-event. Hope to see you there!
