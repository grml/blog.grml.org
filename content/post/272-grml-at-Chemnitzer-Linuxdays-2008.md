title: grml at Chemnitzer Linuxdays 2008

---
Several grml developers will be at the [Chemnitzer linuxdays 2008](http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2008/info/) on the following weekend (1st and 2nd of march). We would highly appreciate to meet grml users at the [grml booth](http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2008/live/detail.html?idx=174). We will present the new stable releases (CDs are being printed right now!), will sell grml\-on\-USB pens, a demo system and will have a developer meeting. If you have any questions, feature requests or feedback please meet us at the [grml booth](http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2008/live/detail.html?idx=174)!
