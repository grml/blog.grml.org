A first public version of kernel [2\.6\.16\-grml is available](http://dufo.tugraz.at/~prokop/grml-kernel/2.6.16-grml/). It includes support for speakup and the new squashfs version 3\.0\. Notice: reiser4 is included but causes problems.  

Currently nvidia\-kernel, openafs, qc\-usb, sl\-modem, linux\-wlan\-ng and eagle\-usb are missing from the external modules list, caused by building problems. grml\-kerneladdons needs to be updated as well. I also found bugs in the [exmap](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=exmap-modules-source) and [nozomi](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=nozomi-source) source package.
BTW: Propably we still can't integrate loop\-aes as we need CONFIG\_BLK\_DEV\_LOOP\=y and this seems to conflict with loop\-aes requirements. :\-/
The ISO\-build grml 0\.6\-7c is running with 2\.6\.16\-grml already. Fixing the above mentioned problems is on my todo\-list now. I'll provide a new develrelease very soon...
**Update:** a new kernel build (grml.04\) without reiser4 is available and included in new develrelease grml 0\.6\-7
