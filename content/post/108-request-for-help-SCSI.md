I'm preparing the development release for the upcoming grml 0\.5 release. As we have a kernel upgrade in this release (using 2\.6\.13\-grml) and I'm still lacking hardware using SCSI\-controllers for booting I request your help. If you have access to a computer which is able to **boot via SCSI** please help me. You just have to send me the file '/proc/pci' and which module is used for the device (if you don't know which one is used just send me output of 'lsmod' and the kernel configuration). Just [drop me a mail](https://grml.org/contact/) (mika \[at] grml.org), your help is appreciated!
