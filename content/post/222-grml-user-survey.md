The first [grml user survey is online](https://grml.org/user-survey/grml.txt). The purpose of this is to help grml developers gain a better idea of what the grml user community is really doing and using, and what aspects people would most like to see improved. Please [contribute](https://grml.org/user-survey/grml.txt)!
