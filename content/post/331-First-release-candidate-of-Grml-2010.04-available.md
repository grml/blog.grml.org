We just released the first release candidate of Grml 2010\.04 which features kernel 2\.6\.33\-grml\[64] and provides several new and nifty features. Check out the [official release notes](http://grml.org/changelogs/README-grml-2010.04/) for all the glory details. As usual the ISOs can be downloaded from the 'devel' directory of the mirrors listed on [grml.org/download/](http://grml.org/download/).
