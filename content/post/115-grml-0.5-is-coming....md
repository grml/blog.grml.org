title: grml 0.5 is coming...

---
We are "in the freeze phase" since sunday with pre\-release grml 0\.4\-9\. I fixed some minor stuff in the last few days and now I'm bringing documentation up to date and running some final checks. Tomorrow (friday) will be a last develmeeting before the new release is going to be published (planned for 24th of october). There have been so many improvements since grml 0\.4 that writing the changelog is a really heavy task. :\-)
BTW: Using the latest unionfs\-release provides a working module\-assistant even on live\-CD. This means that you will be able to build your own kernelmodules in live\-cd\-mode of grml 0\.5 now. :\-)
Ok, probably and hopefully this was the last status message before grml 0\.5 will be available \- so stay tuned! :\-)
