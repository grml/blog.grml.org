I'm working on quality management those days. Today I checked 284 (a\*\-dillo) out of 2470 packages shipped with grml for new upstream releases and got 13 hits which [I reported to Debian's BTS](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?submitter=mika@grml.org) of course. I'll continue with this (awful boring) kind of work in the next days...
