A user asked for them in \#grml on IRC and so I just built packages (including the kernel\-modules and the utilities) for the [Ralink rt2400 and rt2500 chipsets](http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page).
You can find them in [the grml\-repos](https://grml.org/repos/). Feedback welcome.
